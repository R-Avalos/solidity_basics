// Crypto zombies lesson 1

// Overview
// Zombie attributes based on 16 digit integer using modulo operations

// State variables are variables PERMANENTLY stored in the contract on the Ethereum blockchain  (push to database)

// uint = only positive integers (no negative "sing" for unsigned integers). int = can be negative or positive

// Structs
// Structs allow more complicated data types with multiple properties
e.g.
struct Person {
	uint age;
	string name;
	uint stamina;
	uint charisma;
	uint strength;
	uint intelligence;
}

//////////////  Arrays
// fixed and dynamic arrays
uint[2] fixedArray; = array with fixed lenghth of 2 elements
uint[] dyanmicArray; = array with no fixed length
One can create an array of structs...
Person[] people; = dynamic array titled people, that holds persons

Public Arrays... declare an array as public and Solidity will create a "getter" method.
Person[] public people;

Push Items to an arry
Person Bob = Person(42, "Bob"); // create a person entity Bob
people.push(Bob); // Push Bob entity into the people array.   People.action is the convention
or declare in one line:
people.push(Person(42, "Bob")) 


////////////// Functions
Function _parameters, as a convention, start with an underscore to seperate them from global variables
Standard function that takes parameters, does an operation, and provides output
